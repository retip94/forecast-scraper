## General info
Unfortunately cannot share the code anymore, because I've sold it.

The app gets input coordinates from excel file (for customer convenience) and gathers hourly 
wind or water level forecasts for next days. All the gathered data is saved to a new excel file.


## Future
In the future it will also gather forecast for solar UV index.
